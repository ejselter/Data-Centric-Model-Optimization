# Data-Centric-Model-Optimization
Kaggle Competition

Instead of submitting predictions, the goal of this competition was to submit a dataset that was used to train a random forest regressor model. This model was then be used to make predictions against a hidden test dataset. 

The model was evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the model predictions and ground truth of the test set.
